				<div class="text">Sydney is a vibrant city known for its yacht-studded harbour, superb beaches and the iconic Opera House with its towering sail structure. Once a British colony of exiled convicts, Sydney has grown into Australia’s most diverse and cosmopolitan city with an exciting food, arts and entertainment scene.

There’s a huge variety of sights in Sydney, with historic streets and museums to explore, thriving markets, and shopping centres – both grand old icons and gleaming modern retail palaces. Elsewhere, you can enjoy coastal walks and its spectacular Harbour Bridge that could be climbed by day or seen in its full glittering glory at night from a bar with a view.</div>

  <div class="middle">
    <div class="text">Singapore has been described as a playground for the rich, and it's true that the small city-state does have a certain sheen of wealth. But Singapore offers more than just high-end shopping malls, luxury hotels, and fine dining (though it's worth indulging in those a bit if you can). There is also a vibrant history and diverse ethnic quarters to discover, along with many family-friendly attractions and lovely public spaces that make visiting this slightly futuristic city worthwhile.

Singapore has an excellent public transportation system that makes getting around convenient and easy. Once you've gotten a sense of the metro map, you'll have no problem zipping from one part of town to the next. English is spoken everywhere, and signs are in English as well. In fact, Singapore is one of the easiest and most comfortable countries to navigate in Southeast Asia.</div>

  <div class="middle">
    <div class="text">The Emirate of Dubai is the second largest of the seven United Arab Emirates but has the largest population with over 3.33 million inhabitants as of Sept.2019. Dubai's cityscape is always transient and ever-changing with its constant urge to construct bigger and better than before. If there was a Palm Island, Nakheel thought of the World Island. Burj Al Arab was eclipsed when Burj Khalifa cropped up.

Dubai constantly competes with itself, trying to magnetize tourists to a dream-like world of attractions. This drive is clearly visible in its landmarks, shopping centres, parks and hotels.</div>
